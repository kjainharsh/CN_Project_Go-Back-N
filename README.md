# Go-Back-N ARQ Protocol Simulation

This project is a simulation of the **Go-Back-N Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ)** protocol, implemented as part of a Computer Networks course. It demonstrates how reliable data transmission can be achieved over an unreliable communication channel using a sliding window protocol.

## 🧠 What is Go-Back-N?
Go-Back-N is a type of ARQ protocol where the sender can send multiple frames before needing an acknowledgment, but if any one frame is lost or corrupted, **all subsequent frames are retransmitted** starting from that frame.
